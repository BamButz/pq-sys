Autogenerated Rust bindings for libpq

Building
--------

This repository contains direct, one-to-one mappings to the C functions provided
in `libpq-fe.h` and `postgres_ext.h`. This library expects that libpq be
installed on the system.

You may need to specify the environment variable `LIB_PQ_DIR` to the location of
your postgresql lib directory if the build fails.

The build script instructs Cargo to link the library statically if the environmental
variable `LIB_PQ_STATIC` is set. This can be useful, if targeting for a musl target.

For OSX 10.11 you can use brew to install postgresql and then set the
environment variable as described below:

```
brew install openssl
export PQ_LIB_DIR=`brew --prefix postgresql`/lib
```
